# Policy CRUD Operations - Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for implementing Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations for Cedar policies in the Hodei Artifacts system. This functionality will enable Security Administrators to dynamically manage authorization rules through a REST API, building upon the Cedar policy engine integration established in Story 4.1.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Policy Data Model and Storage

**User Story:** As a System Architect, I want a robust data model for storing Cedar policies in MongoDB, so that policies can be persisted, versioned, and efficiently retrieved.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN a policy data model is defined THEN it SHALL include fields for policy ID, name, description, Cedar policy content, status, and metadata
2. WHEN policies are stored THEN they SHALL be persisted in MongoDB with proper indexing for efficient queries
3. WHEN policy content is stored THEN it SHALL preserve the original Cedar DSL syntax exactly as provided
4. WHEN policies are created THEN they SHALL be assigned unique identifiers following HRN format
5. WHEN policy metadata is stored THEN it SHALL include creation timestamp, last modified timestamp, and author information

### Requirement 2: Policy REST API Endpoints

**User Story:** As a Security Administrator, I want REST API endpoints for policy management, so that I can create, read, update, and delete Cedar policies programmatically.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN the API is implemented THEN it SHALL expose endpoints at `/policies` for policy operations
2. WHEN a POST request is made to `/policies` THEN it SHALL create a new policy with the provided Cedar content
3. WHEN a GET request is made to `/policies/{id}` THEN it SHALL retrieve a specific policy by its ID
4. WHEN a GET request is made to `/policies` THEN it SHALL return a paginated list of all policies
5. WHEN a PUT request is made to `/policies/{id}` THEN it SHALL update an existing policy with new content
6. WHEN a DELETE request is made to `/policies/{id}` THEN it SHALL remove the policy from the system

### Requirement 3: Policy Content Validation

**User Story:** As a Security Administrator, I want Cedar policy syntax validation, so that only valid policies can be stored in the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN a policy is created or updated THEN the Cedar content SHALL be validated for syntax correctness
2. WHEN invalid Cedar syntax is provided THEN the API SHALL return a 400 Bad Request error with detailed validation messages
3. WHEN policy validation fails THEN the operation SHALL be rejected and no changes SHALL be persisted
4. WHEN policy content is valid THEN it SHALL be accepted and stored successfully
5. WHEN validation is performed THEN it SHALL use the Cedar policy engine's built-in validation capabilities

### Requirement 4: Policy Status Management

**User Story:** As a Security Administrator, I want to manage policy lifecycle states, so that I can control which policies are active in the authorization system.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN a policy is created THEN it SHALL have a status field with values: Draft, Active, Inactive, Deprecated
2. WHEN a policy status is Draft THEN it SHALL NOT be used for authorization decisions
3. WHEN a policy status is Active THEN it SHALL be included in authorization evaluations
4. WHEN a policy status is changed THEN the change SHALL be logged with timestamp and user information
5. WHEN policies are retrieved THEN the response SHALL include the current status

### Requirement 5: Error Handling and Validation

**User Story:** As a Developer, I want comprehensive error handling for policy operations, so that I can understand and resolve issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN validation errors occur THEN they SHALL return structured error responses with specific field-level details
2. WHEN a policy is not found THEN the API SHALL return a 404 Not Found error
3. WHEN unauthorized access is attempted THEN the API SHALL return a 403 Forbidden error
4. WHEN server errors occur THEN they SHALL be logged with correlation IDs for debugging
5. WHEN errors are returned THEN they SHALL follow the project's standard error response format

### Requirement 6: Integration with Authorization System

**User Story:** As a System Architect, I want policy CRUD operations to integrate with the existing authorization system, so that policy changes are reflected in access control decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN policies are modified THEN the security crate SHALL be notified to refresh its policy cache
2. WHEN policy status changes to Active THEN it SHALL be immediately available for authorization decisions
3. WHEN policy status changes to Inactive THEN it SHALL be excluded from authorization evaluations
4. WHEN policies are deleted THEN they SHALL be removed from the authorization engine
5. WHEN policy operations complete THEN appropriate domain events SHALL be published

### Requirement 7: Comprehensive Testing

**User Story:** As a Developer, I want comprehensive tests for policy CRUD operations, so that I can be confident in the system's reliability and correctness.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN unit tests are written THEN they SHALL cover all policy service methods and validation logic
2. WHEN integration tests are created THEN they SHALL test the complete CRUD lifecycle with real MongoDB
3. WHEN API tests are implemented THEN they SHALL verify all HTTP endpoints with various scenarios
4. WHEN error scenarios are tested THEN they SHALL include invalid syntax, missing policies, and authorization failures
5. WHEN tests are executed THEN they SHALL achieve >90% code coverage for policy management logic

### Requirement 8: Code Quality and Standards Compliance

**User Story:** As a Team Lead, I want all policy CRUD code to follow established standards, so that the codebase remains maintainable and consistent.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN code is written THEN it SHALL pass `cargo fmt` formatting checks
2. WHEN code is analyzed THEN it SHALL pass `cargo clippy -- -D warnings` without warnings
3. WHEN the IAM crate is structured THEN it SHALL follow the project's Vertical Slice Architecture
4. WHEN error handling is implemented THEN it SHALL use custom error types with `thiserror`
5. WHEN API endpoints are implemented THEN they SHALL follow RESTful conventions and project standards
6. WHEN database operations are performed THEN they SHALL use the repository pattern for data access abstraction
