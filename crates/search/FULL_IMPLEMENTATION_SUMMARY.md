## Technical Implementation Details

### 1. SOLID Principles Applied

#### Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
Each component has a single, well-defined responsibility:
- `SearchEnginePort`: Only responsible for search operations
- `IndexerPort`: Only responsible for indexing operations
- `TokenizerPort`: Only responsible for text tokenization
- `ScorerPort`: Only responsible for relevance scoring
- `BasicSearchUseCase`/`AdvancedQueryUseCase`: Only responsible for business logic coordination

#### Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
Components are open for extension but closed for modification:
- New search engines can be added by implementing `SearchEnginePort`
- New indexing strategies can be added by implementing `IndexerPort`
- New tokenization algorithms can be added by implementing `TokenizerPort`
- New scoring algorithms can be added by implementing `ScorerPort`

#### Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
Interfaces can be substituted with concrete implementations:
- `TantivySearchAdapter` can be substituted wherever `SearchEnginePort` is used
- `MockSearchAdapter` can be substituted for testing

#### Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
Clients depend only on methods they use:
- Separate interfaces for search, indexing, tokenization, and scoring
- Each interface is focused on a specific concern

#### Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
Components depend on abstractions, not concretions:
- `BasicSearchUseCase` depends on `SearchEnginePort`, not `TantivySearchAdapter`
- Dependency injection is used to wire up concrete implementations

### 2. Tantivy Integration

The implementation leverages Tantivy's full-text search capabilities while maintaining abstraction:

#### Schema Design
- Custom schema with appropriate field types and indexing options
- TEXT fields for content that should be analyzed
- STRING fields for exact matches
- STORED fields for retrieving values
- INDEXED fields for search operations

#### Analyzer Configuration
- Language-specific analyzers with stemming and stop-word removal
- Custom tokenizer configuration for different content types
- Support for multilingual text processing

#### Query Building
- Efficient query construction with proper escaping and normalization
- Support for complex query expressions
- Phrase matching and wildcard support

#### Result Processing
- Proper handling of search results with relevance scoring
- Highlighting for search terms
- Snippet generation for context

### 3. Performance Optimization

#### Search Latency
- Target: <50ms p99 for typical queries
- Efficient query parsing and execution
- Caching strategies for frequent queries

#### Indexing Throughput
- Target: 1000+ artifacts/second
- Batch indexing for improved performance
- Incremental indexing for ongoing updates

#### Memory Usage
- Efficient resource utilization
- Proper cleanup of temporary resources
- Memory pooling where appropriate

#### Concurrency
- Thread-safe implementations
- Lock-free designs where possible
- Connection pooling for external services

### 4. Security Considerations

#### Query Sanitization
- Prevention of injection attacks
- Proper escaping of special characters
- Validation of query syntax

#### Resource Limits
- Protection against resource exhaustion
- Query complexity limits
- Timeout mechanisms for long-running operations

#### Access Control
- Integration with existing authorization
- Proper permission checking for search operations
- Audit trails for sensitive searches

#### Data Privacy
- Proper handling of sensitive content
- Encryption at rest for indexed data
- Compliance with privacy regulations
