## SOLID Principles Applied

### 1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
Each component has a single, well-defined responsibility:
- `SearchEnginePort`: Only responsible for search operations
- `IndexerPort`: Only responsible for indexing operations
- `TokenizerPort`: Only responsible for text tokenization
- `ScorerPort`: Only responsible for relevance scoring
- `FullTextSearchUseCase`: Only responsible for business logic coordination

### 2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
Components are open for extension but closed for modification:
- New search engines can be added by implementing `SearchEnginePort`
- New indexing strategies can be added by implementing `IndexerPort`
- New tokenization algorithms can be added by implementing `TokenizerPort`
- New scoring algorithms can be added by implementing `ScorerPort`

### 3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
Interfaces can be substituted with concrete implementations:
- `TantivySearchEngineAdapter` can be substituted wherever `SearchEnginePort` is used
- `MockSearchEngineAdapter` can be substituted for testing

### 4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
Clients depend only on methods they use:
- Separate interfaces for search, indexing, tokenization, and scoring
- Each interface is focused on a specific concern

### 5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
Components depend on abstractions, not concretions:
- `FullTextSearchUseCase` depends on `SearchEnginePort`, not `TantivySearchEngineAdapter`
- Dependency injection is used to wire up concrete implementations

## Tantivy Integration Details

### Schema Design
- Custom schema with appropriate field types:
  - TEXT fields for content that should be analyzed
  - STRING fields for exact matches
  - STORED fields for retrieving values
  - INDEXED fields for search operations
- Proper field configuration for different content types
- Support for multilingual text processing

### Analyzer Configuration
- Language-specific analyzers with stemming and stop-word removal
- Custom tokenizer configuration for different content types
- Support for phrase matching and wildcard queries

### Query Building
- Efficient query construction with proper escaping and normalization
- Support for complex query expressions
- Phrase matching and wildcard support

### Result Processing
- Proper handling of search results with relevance scoring
- Highlighting for search terms
