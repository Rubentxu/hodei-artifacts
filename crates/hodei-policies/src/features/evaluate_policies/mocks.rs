//! Mocks for the evaluate_policies feature
//!
//! This module provides mock implementations of the ports for testing.
//! Since the evaluate_policies use case currently has no external dependencies,
//! this module is minimal and may be expanded if ports are added in the future.

// Note: Currently no ports are defined for evaluate_policies, so no mocks are needed.
// If external dependencies are added (e.g., caching, metrics), their mock implementations
// would be defined here for use in use_case_test.rs.
