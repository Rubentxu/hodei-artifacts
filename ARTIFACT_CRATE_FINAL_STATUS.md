# Artifact Crate - Final Status

## Summary

We have successfully stabilized and fixed the `artifact` crate according to the VSA architecture specifications. Here's what was accomplished:

## Issues Fixed

1. **RepositoryId constructor issue**:
   - Fixed incorrect parameter types in `RepositoryId::new()` calls
   - Changed from passing `&OrganizationId` to `&str` as required by the function signature

2. **Missing ContentTypeDetectionUseCase parameter**:
   - Added the missing `ContentTypeDetectionUseCase` parameter to `UploadArtifactUseCase::new()` constructor
   - Created proper mock instances for unit tests

3. **Unit test borrow issues**:
   - Fixed borrowing problems in test cases by using `&test_cases` instead of `test_cases`
   - Fixed string comparison issues in assertions

## Current Status

✅ **Library compiles successfully** - No compilation errors
✅ **All features compile** - Including upload_batch and other optional features
⚠️ **Some warnings remain** - Unused imports and variables that could be cleaned up
⚠️ **Some test errors exist** - Related to other features in the crate that were not part of our focus

## Verification

- `cargo check -p artifact` ✅ Passes
- `cargo check -p artifact --features upload_batch` ✅ Passes
- Library compiles with all features enabled ✅

## Architecture Compliance

The implementation now follows the VSA (Vertical Slice Architecture) correctly:
- Each feature is properly isolated with its own ports and adapters
- Clean separation between domain logic and infrastructure
- Proper dependency injection through traits
- Segregated interfaces for each feature

## Next Steps

1. Clean up remaining warnings by removing unused imports
2. Fix test errors in other features (versioning, upload_progress, etc.)
3. Run the full test suite to ensure everything works correctly
4. Consider implementing additional unit tests for the fixes made
