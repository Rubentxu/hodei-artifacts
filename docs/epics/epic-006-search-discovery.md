# Epic: Search & Discovery - Unified Artifact Search

## Epic Goal

Implement unified search capabilities across artifacts, metadata, and dependencies with advanced filtering, dependency-based search, and comprehensive search analytics for optimal artifact discovery and management.

## Epic Description

### Existing System Context

**Current State:**
- Search crate exists with basic structure
- No search indexing or query implementation
- No unified search interface
- Missing dependency-based search capabilities
- No search analytics or reporting

**Technology Stack:**
- Rust with search indexing libraries (Tantivy)
- Full-text search capabilities
- Query parsing and filtering
- Analytics and reporting frameworks
- Integration with existing metadata stores

**Integration Points:**
- Core artifact management for artifact metadata
- Supply chain security for dependency relationships
- Repository management for repository-specific search
- Policy engine for search result filtering

### Enhancement Details

**What's being added:**
- Unified search across artifacts, metadata, and dependencies
- Advanced filtering and sorting capabilities
- Dependency-based search and relationship queries
- Full-text search with fuzzy matching
- Search analytics and user behavior tracking
- Integration with business intelligence tools
- Predictive search suggestions

**How it integrates:**
- Indexes all artifact metadata and content
- Provides search API for all client interfaces
- Enables dependency graph traversal through search
- Filters results based on user permissions and policies
- Tracks search patterns for optimization and analytics

**Success criteria:**
- Users can find artifacts quickly and accurately
- Advanced filtering supports complex queries
- Dependency relationships are searchable
- Search performance meets requirements
- Analytics provide insights into usage patterns

## Stories

### Story 1: Unified Search & Indexing
- **Description**: Implement core search functionality with indexing across artifacts, metadata, and content
- **Key requirements**: FR-SEARCH-1, metadata search, full-text indexing, query parsing
- **Integration**: Artifact storage, metadata extraction, indexing infrastructure

### Story 2: Advanced Search & Filtering
- **Description**: Advanced search capabilities with filtering, sorting, and dependency-based queries
- **Key requirements**: Advanced filtering, dependency search, fuzzy matching
- **Integration**: Dependency graph, metadata schemas, policy filtering

### Story 3: Search Analytics & Intelligence
- **Description**: Search analytics, user behavior tracking, and predictive search capabilities
- **Key requirements**: FR-SEARCH-2, analytics tracking, BI integration, suggestions
- **Integration**: Event tracking, analytics storage, machine learning

## Requirements Coverage

**Functional Requirements:**
- ✅ FR-SEARCH-1: Unified search across metadata, full-text, and Merkle root
- ✅ FR-SEARCH-1.1: Fuzzy search support
- ✅ FR-SEARCH-1.2: Integration with full-text search capabilities
- ✅ FR-SEARCH-2: Search analytics and performance metrics
- ✅ FR-SEARCH-2.1: Business intelligence integration
- ✅ FR-SEARCH-2.2: Predictive search suggestions

**Performance Requirements:**
- ✅ Search response time under 100ms for 95% of queries
- ✅ Support for complex multi-field filtering
- ✅ Scalable indexing for millions of artifacts
- ✅ Real-time index updates

## Dependencies

### Must Complete Before:
- Core Artifact Management (epic-001) - artifacts to search
- Supply Chain Security (epic-005) - dependency relationships

### Integration Dependencies:
- Artifact management for metadata indexing
- Supply chain for dependency graph queries
- Policy engine for result filtering
- Repository management for repository-specific search

### External Dependencies:
- Search indexing libraries (Tantivy)
- Analytics and BI integration tools
- Query parsing and optimization libraries

## Risk Assessment

### Primary Risks:
- **Performance**: Search performance at scale with millions of artifacts
- **Relevance**: Search result relevance and ranking quality
- **Complexity**: Complex query patterns and filtering requirements

### Mitigation Strategies:
- Efficient indexing strategies and query optimization
- Machine learning for relevance ranking
- Incremental implementation with user feedback

### Rollback Plan:
- Fallback to basic metadata search
- Preserve existing search indexes
- Disable advanced features if performance issues
