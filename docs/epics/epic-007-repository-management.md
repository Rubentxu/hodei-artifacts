# Epic: Repository Management - Organization & Governance

## Epic Goal

Implement comprehensive repository management with support for multiple repository types, organization-specific policies, quota management, and hierarchical repository structures for effective artifact organization and governance.

## Epic Description

### Existing System Context

**Current State:**
- Repository crate exists with basic CRUD operations
- Basic repository structure implemented
- Missing advanced repository types (proxy, virtual)
- No quota management or organizational policies
- Limited repository-specific functionality

**Technology Stack:**
- Rust with async database operations
- Repository type abstraction and adapters
- Policy integration for repository governance
- Quota management and monitoring
- Integration with object storage backends

**Integration Points:**
- Organization management for hierarchical structure
- Policy engine for repository-specific policies
- Core artifact management for artifact storage
- Protocol distribution for repository behavior

### Enhancement Details

**What's being added:**
- Complete repository type support (local, proxy, virtual)
- Hierarchical repository organization and management
- Repository-specific policies and governance
- Quota management and storage limits
- Repository replication and synchronization
- Advanced repository grouping and organization
- Repository metadata and configuration management

**How it integrates:**
- Provides organizational structure for artifact storage
- Enforces repository-specific policies and quotas
- Supports different storage strategies per repository type
- Enables proxy repositories for external artifact caching
- Facilitates virtual repositories for aggregation

**Success criteria:**
- Organizations can create and manage multiple repository types
- Repository-specific policies are enforced correctly
- Quota management prevents storage overruns
- Proxy repositories provide external artifact caching
- Virtual repositories enable artifact aggregation
- Repository replication ensures availability

## Stories

### Story 1: Advanced Repository Types & Management
- **Description**: Implement proxy and virtual repository types with advanced management capabilities
- **Key requirements**: FR-REPO-1, repository types, CRUD operations, replication
- **Integration**: Storage backends, policy engine, artifact management

### Story 2: Repository Policies & Quota Management
- **Description**: Repository-specific policies, quota management, and governance features
- **Key requirements**: FR-REPO-2, access control, storage quotas, retention policies
- **Integration**: Policy engine, storage monitoring, organization management

### Story 3: Repository Organization & Hierarchies
- **Description**: Hierarchical repository organization with groups and advanced structuring
- **Key requirements**: Repository groups, organizational alignment, inheritance
- **Integration**: Organization hierarchy, policy inheritance, user management

## Requirements Coverage

**Functional Requirements:**
- ✅ FR-REPO-1: Repository CRUD operations
- ✅ FR-REPO-1.1: HRN for repositories
- ✅ FR-REPO-1.2: Repository replication support
- ✅ FR-REPO-2: Repository-specific policies
- ✅ FR-REPO-2.1: Policy engine integration
- ✅ FR-REPO-2.2: Repository-specific metadata
- ✅ FR-015: Quota management and storage limits

**Repository Types:**
- ✅ Local repositories for direct artifact storage
- ✅ Proxy repositories for external artifact caching
- ✅ Virtual repositories for artifact aggregation
- ✅ Repository groups for organization

## Dependencies

### Must Complete Before:
- Core Artifact Management (epic-001) - artifacts to store
- Policy Engine & Security (epic-004) - policy enforcement
- Identity & Access Management (epic-003) - user permissions

### Integration Dependencies:
- Organization management for hierarchical structure
- Policy engine for repository governance
- Artifact management for storage operations
- Protocol distribution for repository behavior

### External Dependencies:
- External repository systems for proxy functionality
- Storage monitoring and quota systems
- Replication and synchronization services

## Risk Assessment

### Primary Risks:
- **Complexity**: Multiple repository types and configurations
- **Storage**: Quota management and storage optimization
- **Performance**: Proxy repository caching and synchronization

### Mitigation Strategies:
- Clear separation of repository types and responsibilities
- Efficient quota management and monitoring
- Optimized caching and replication strategies

### Rollback Plan:
- Disable advanced repository types
- Maintain basic local repository functionality
- Preserve existing repository configurations

## Definition of Done
