# Epic: Core Artifact Management - Foundation Features

## Epic Goal

Implement the fundamental artifact management capabilities that form the core of Hodei Artifacts, providing secure upload, download, integrity verification, and version management for all software artifacts.

## Epic Description

### Existing System Context

**Current State:**
- Repository management functionality exists (create, delete, get repositories)
- Basic project structure is in place with crates for different bounded contexts
- Some features implemented in repository crate following VSA pattern
- Missing: Core artifact upload/download functionality

**Technology Stack:**
- Rust with Tokio for async operations
- Vertical Slice Architecture (VSA) pattern
- MongoDB/SurrealDB for metadata storage
- Object storage for binary artifacts

**Integration Points:**
- Repository crate for artifact storage location
- Shared crate for HRN generation and common types
- IAM crate for authentication and authorization

### Enhancement Details

**What's being added:**
- Complete artifact lifecycle management (upload, download, delete)
- Integrity verification with SHA-256/SHA-512
- Duplicate detection and handling
- Semantic versioning support
- Multipart upload for large files
- HRN-based artifact identification

**How it integrates:**
- Extends existing repository infrastructure
- Uses established VSA patterns from other features
- Integrates with policy engine for access control
- Connects to object storage backend

**Success criteria:**
- Teams can upload artifacts with integrity verification
- Downloads are secure and verified
- Duplicate artifacts are properly handled
- Version management follows semantic versioning
- Large file uploads are efficient and resumable

## Stories

### Story 1: Basic Artifact Upload & Download
- **Description**: Implement core upload/download with integrity verification
- **Key requirements**: FR-001, HRN generation, checksum validation
- **Integration**: Repository management, object storage

### Story 2: Duplicate Detection & Management
- **Description**: Detect and handle duplicate artifacts based on cryptographic hashes
- **Key requirements**: FR-011, real-time detection, handling options
- **Integration**: Artifact storage, metadata management

### Story 3: Semantic Versioning & Multipart Upload
- **Description**: Implement version validation and large file upload support
- **Key requirements**: FR-012, FR-010, chunked uploads, resume capability
- **Integration**: Upload pipeline, storage optimization

## Requirements Coverage

**Functional Requirements:**
- ✅ FR-001: Artifact upload/download with integrity verification
- ✅ FR-004: HRN generation and management
- ✅ FR-010: Multipart upload support
- ✅ FR-011: Duplicate detection
- ✅ FR-012: Semantic versioning
- ✅ FR-013: Audit logging for all operations

**Architecture Alignment:**
- ✅ Follows established VSA pattern
- ✅ Uses existing crate structure
- ✅ Integrates with policy engine
- ✅ Maintains clean separation of concerns

## Dependencies

### Must Complete Before:
- Repository management (existing functionality must be stable)

### Integration Dependencies:
- IAM crate for authentication
- Policies crate for access control
- Shared crate for HRN and common types

### External Dependencies:
- Object storage backend
- Cryptographic hash libraries

## Risk Assessment

### Primary Risks:
- **Performance**: Large file uploads may impact system performance
- **Storage**: Efficient storage of duplicate artifacts
- **Security**: Proper access control for sensitive artifacts

### Mitigation Strategies:
- Implement streaming uploads and bandwidth throttling
- Use content-addressable storage for deduplication
- Integrate with policy engine for comprehensive security

### Rollback Plan:
- Disable new upload features
- Maintain existing repository functionality
- Preserve uploaded artifacts and metadata

## Definition of Done
