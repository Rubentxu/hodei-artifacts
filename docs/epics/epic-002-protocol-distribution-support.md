# Epic: Protocol Distribution Support - Native Protocol Compatibility

## Epic Goal

Implement native protocol support for Maven, npm, and Docker to enable seamless integration with existing development workflows without requiring client-side modifications.

## Epic Description

### Existing System Context

**Current State:**
- Core artifact management functionality (being implemented)
- Basic repository structure with distribution crate exists
- No protocol-specific implementations completed
- Need for protocol adapters that translate client requests to core operations

**Technology Stack:**
- Rust with Axum for HTTP handling
- Protocol-specific parsing libraries
- Integration with core artifact management
- Event-driven architecture for metadata generation

**Integration Points:**
- Core artifact management (upload/download operations)
- Repository management (protocol-specific repository types)
- IAM for authentication (protocol-specific auth mechanisms)
- Metadata extraction and storage

### Enhancement Details

**What's being added:**
- Native Maven protocol support (deploy, install, metadata)
- Native npm protocol support (publish, install, scoped packages)
- Native Docker Registry API v2 support (push, pull, manifests)
- Protocol-specific metadata extraction and generation
- Authentication integration per protocol standards

**How it integrates:**
- Translates protocol requests to core artifact operations
- Extracts and stores protocol-specific metadata
- Handles protocol-specific authentication flows
- Generates standard metadata files (maven-metadata.xml, package.json handling)

**Success criteria:**
- `mvn deploy` and `mvn install` work without client modifications
- `npm publish` and `npm install` function correctly
- `docker push` and `docker pull` work with registry API
- Protocol-specific metadata is correctly generated and stored
- Authentication works according to each protocol's standards

## Stories

### Story 1: Maven Protocol Implementation
- **Description**: Complete Maven protocol support with deploy/install operations and metadata generation
- **Key requirements**: FR-DIST-1, maven-metadata.xml generation, groupId/artifactId structure
- **Integration**: Core artifact upload, repository management, POM parsing

### Story 2: npm Protocol Implementation
- **Description**: Full npm protocol support including scoped packages and authentication
- **Key requirements**: FR-DIST-2, package.json processing, token-based auth
- **Integration**: Artifact management, scope handling, metadata extraction

### Story 3: Docker Registry API v2
- **Description**: Implement Docker Registry API v2 for push/pull operations with manifest handling
- **Key requirements**: FR-DIST-3, layer storage, manifest support, OCI compliance
- **Integration**: Object storage, metadata management, authentication

## Requirements Coverage

**Functional Requirements:**
- ✅ FR-002: Native protocol support for Maven, npm, Docker
- ✅ FR-DIST-1: Maven protocol compatibility
- ✅ FR-DIST-2: npm protocol compatibility  
- ✅ FR-DIST-3: Docker Registry API v2 compatibility
- ✅ FR-013: Audit logging for protocol operations
- ✅ FR-014: Integration with identity providers

**Protocol Compatibility:**
- ✅ Maven 3.8+ compatibility
- ✅ npm 8+ compatibility
- ✅ Docker CLI 20.10+ compatibility
- ✅ OCI image format support

## Dependencies

### Must Complete Before:
- Core Artifact Management (epic-001) - fundamental upload/download operations

### Integration Dependencies:
- IAM for protocol-specific authentication
- Repository management for protocol-specific repo types
- Shared for common types and utilities

### External Dependencies:
- Maven artifact parsing libraries
- npm package.json handling
- Docker manifest parsing libraries

## Risk Assessment

### Primary Risks:
- **Protocol Compatibility**: Ensuring 100% compatibility with existing clients
- **Performance**: Protocol overhead may impact artifact operations
- **Complexity**: Each protocol has unique requirements and edge cases

### Mitigation Strategies:
- Comprehensive testing with official client tools
- Performance optimization and caching strategies
- Incremental implementation with thorough validation

### Rollback Plan:
- Disable specific protocol endpoints
- Maintain core artifact functionality
- Preserve protocol-specific metadata

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All three protocol implementations completed
- [ ] Full compatibility with respective official client tools
- [ ] Protocol-specific metadata generation working correctly
- [ ] Authentication integrated for each protocol
- [ ] Comprehensive test suite including official tool testing
- [ ] Performance benchmarks meet requirements (< 50ms metadata ops)
- [ ] Documentation for each protocol implementation
- [ ] Integration tests with real client tools (Maven, npm, Docker)
- [ ] Error handling follows protocol standards
- [ ] Security review for each protocol implementation

## Success Metrics

- **Protocol Compatibility**: 100% with official client tools
- **Protocol Operations Performance**: p99 latency < 100ms
- **Authentication Success Rate**: > 99% for all protocols
- **Metadata Generation Accuracy**: 100%
- **Client Tool Integration**: All major operations work without modification
