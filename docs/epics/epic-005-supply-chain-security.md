# Epic: Supply Chain Security - Comprehensive Dependency Management

## Epic Goal

Implement comprehensive supply chain security capabilities including dependency graph modeling, vulnerability impact analysis, SBOM generation, and artifact signing to ensure complete software supply chain integrity.

## Epic Description

### Existing System Context

**Current State:**
- Supply-chain crate exists with basic structure
- No dependency graph implementation
- No vulnerability scanning integration
- Missing SBOM generation capabilities
- No artifact signing infrastructure

**Technology Stack:**
- Rust with graph processing capabilities
- Vulnerability database integration (CVE, OSS Index)
- SBOM generation libraries (SPDX, CycloneDX)
- Cryptographic signing libraries (cosign, in-toto)
- Graph database for dependency relationships

**Integration Points:**
- Core artifact management for artifact relationships
- Search engine for dependency-based queries
- Policy engine for security policy enforcement
- External vulnerability databases and scanners

### Enhancement Details

**What's being added:**
- Complete dependency graph modeling with transitive relationship tracking
- Real-time vulnerability impact analysis and blast radius calculation
- Automated SBOM generation in multiple formats
- Artifact signing and verification using industry standards
- Integration with external vulnerability scanners
- Security event alerting and reporting

**How it integrates:**
- Automatically analyzes artifacts during ingestion
- Builds and maintains dependency graph in real-time
- Generates SBOMs for all uploaded artifacts
- Evaluates artifacts against vulnerability databases
- Enforces security policies through policy engine integration

**Success criteria:**
- Complete dependency graph visibility for all artifacts
- Real-time vulnerability impact analysis
- Automated SBOM generation during artifact upload
- Secure artifact signing and verification
- Integration with major vulnerability databases
- Comprehensive security reporting and alerting

## Stories

### Story 1: Dependency Graph & Vulnerability Analysis
- **Description**: Implement dependency graph modeling and real-time vulnerability impact analysis
- **Key requirements**: FR-SCS-1, FR-SCS-2, graph storage, blast radius calculation
- **Integration**: Artifact management, vulnerability databases, search engine

### Story 2: SBOM Generation & Management
- **Description**: Automated SBOM generation in SPDX and CycloneDX formats with integrity verification
- **Key requirements**: FR-SCS-3, format support, automated generation, enrichment
- **Integration**: Artifact upload pipeline, metadata storage, policy engine

### Story 3: Artifact Signing & Verification
- **Description**: Implement artifact signing using cosign and in-tito for provenance verification
- **Key requirements**: FR-SCS-4, signature management, verification pipeline
- **Integration**: Upload/download operations, certificate authorities, policy enforcement

## Requirements Coverage

**Functional Requirements:**
- ✅ FR-SCS-1: Dependency graph modeling and historical tracking
- ✅ FR-SCS-2: Vulnerability impact analysis and blast radius reports
- ✅ FR-SCS-3: SBOM generation in SPDX and CycloneDX formats
- ✅ FR-SCS-4: Artifact signing and verification integration
- ✅ FR-SCS-4.1: Fulcio certificate issuance integration
- ✅ FR-SCS-4.2: Malware scanning integration
- ✅ FR-013: Security event audit logging

**Security Requirements:**
- ✅ Comprehensive supply chain visibility
- ✅ Real-time vulnerability detection
- ✅ Cryptographic integrity verification
- ✅ Provenance tracking and verification

## Dependencies

### Must Complete Before:
- Core Artifact Management (epic-001) - artifacts to analyze
- Policy Engine & Security (epic-004) - security policy enforcement

### Integration Dependencies:
- Artifact management for ingestion analysis
- Search engine for dependency queries
- Policy engine for security enforcement
- External vulnerability feeds and scanners

### External Dependencies:
- CVE and OSS Index databases
- Snyk, Trivy vulnerability scanners
- SPDX and CycloneDX libraries
- cosign, in-tito, Fulcio for signing

## Risk Assessment

### Primary Risks:
- **Performance**: Dependency analysis could impact upload performance
- **Complexity**: Graph algorithms and vulnerability analysis are complex
- **Data Volume**: Large dependency graphs require significant storage

### Mitigation Strategies:
- Asynchronous processing and background analysis
- Optimized graph algorithms and caching
- Efficient storage strategies and data pruning

### Rollback Plan:
- Disable real-time analysis (batch processing only)
- Preserve existing dependency data
- Maintain basic vulnerability reporting
