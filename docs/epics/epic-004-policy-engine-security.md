# Epic: Policy Engine & Security - Cedar-Based Access Control

## Epic Goal

Implement comprehensive policy management and enforcement using Cedar, providing real-time policy evaluation, interactive policy validation, and hierarchical policy inheritance for secure artifact repository operations.

## Epic Description

### Existing System Context

**Current State:**
- Policies crate exists with basic structure
- Cedar policy engine integration planned but not implemented
- No policy management interface or evaluation system
- Missing policy validation and testing capabilities

**Technology Stack:**
- Rust with Cedar policy engine integration
- Real-time policy evaluation framework
- Policy validation and parsing libraries
- Integration with all bounded contexts

**Integration Points:**
- IAM for user and group context
- All bounded contexts requiring authorization
- Organization management for hierarchical policies
- Audit logging for policy decisions

### Enhancement Details

**What's being added:**
- Complete Cedar policy integration for real-time evaluation
- Interactive policy playground for validation and testing
- Policy versioning and history tracking
- Hierarchical policy inheritance (Service Control Policies)
- Policy coverage analysis and gap detection
- Real-time policy evaluation at all access points

**How it integrates:**
- Evaluates policies before any resource access
- Integrates with HRN for resource identification
- Supports organizational hierarchy for policy inheritance
- Provides audit trail for all policy decisions

**Success criteria:**
- All resource access decisions are policy-driven
- Interactive playground enables policy testing
- Policy inheritance works across organizational hierarchy
- Coverage analysis identifies policy gaps
- Performance meets real-time evaluation requirements

## Stories

### Story 1: Cedar Policy Integration & Real-time Evaluation
- **Description**: Integrate Cedar policy engine and implement real-time policy evaluation for all resource access
- **Key requirements**: FR-POL-1, FR-POL-2, HRN-based resource identification, real-time evaluation
- **Integration**: All bounded contexts, IAM for user context, audit logging

### Story 2: Policy Playground & Validation
- **Description**: Create interactive policy playground for testing, validation, and policy development
- **Key requirements**: Interactive validation, policy testing, error highlighting
- **Integration**: Policy engine, web interface, policy parsing

### Story 3: Policy Versioning & Hierarchical Inheritance
- **Description**: Implement policy versioning, history tracking, and Service Control Policy inheritance
- **Key requirements**: Policy versioning, organizational inheritance, SCP management
- **Integration**: Organization management, policy storage, audit trail

## Requirements Coverage

**Functional Requirements:**
- ✅ FR-POL-1: Policy definition and management using Cedar
- ✅ FR-POL-1.1: Real-time policy evaluation
- ✅ FR-POL-1.2: Coverage reports and gap analysis
- ✅ FR-POL-2: Policy enforcement with HRN integration
- ✅ FR-POL-2.1: Service Control Policies (SCPs) support
- ✅ FR-POL-2.2: Hierarchical policy inheritance
- ✅ FR-013: Comprehensive audit logging for policy decisions

**Security Requirements:**
- ✅ Policy-based access control for all resources
- ✅ Context-aware policy evaluation
- ✅ Policy validation and security analysis
- ✅ Comprehensive audit trail

## Dependencies

### Must Complete Before:
- Identity & Access Management (epic-003) - provides user and group context
- Core Artifact Management (epic-001) - primary resources to protect

### Integration Dependencies:
- IAM for user and group context
- Organization management for hierarchical policies
- All bounded contexts requiring authorization
- Shared for HRN and common types

### External Dependencies:
- Cedar policy engine libraries
- Policy parsing and validation tools

## Risk Assessment

### Primary Risks:
- **Performance**: Real-time policy evaluation could impact system performance
- **Complexity**: Policy configuration and inheritance can be complex
- **Security**: Policy misconfiguration could create security vulnerabilities

### Mitigation Strategies:
- Performance optimization with caching and evaluation strategies
- User-friendly policy management tools and validation
- Comprehensive testing and security review processes

### Rollback Plan:
- Fallback to simple role-based access control
- Preserve existing policy configurations
- Disable complex policy features if issues arise
