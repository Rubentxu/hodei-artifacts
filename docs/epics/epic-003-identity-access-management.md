# Epic: Identity & Access Management - Secure User Management

## Epic Goal

Implement comprehensive identity and access management with user lifecycle management, authentication integration, and role-based access control for secure artifact repository operations.

## Epic Description

### Existing System Context

**Current State:**
- Basic IAM crate structure exists
- No user management functionality implemented
- No authentication integrations completed
- Missing authorization mechanisms for resource access

**Technology Stack:**
- Rust with async authentication libraries
- OIDC/SAML/LDAP integration capabilities
- Cedar policy engine integration
- Database for user and organization data

**Integration Points:**
- Policy engine for authorization decisions
- All bounded contexts requiring access control
- External identity providers
- Organization management for hierarchical structure

### Enhancement Details

**What's being added:**
- Complete user lifecycle management (create, update, delete users)
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA) support
- Integration with external identity providers (Google, GitHub, Azure AD)
- Token-based authentication for API access
- Group management and role assignment
- HRN-based user identification

**How it integrates:**
- Provides authentication context to all bounded contexts
- Integrates with Cedar policy engine for authorization
- Supports organizational hierarchy and inheritance
- Enables audit logging for security events

**Success criteria:**
- Users can be managed through comprehensive UI and API
- External identity provider integration works seamlessly
- MFA provides additional security layer
- Token-based authentication enables automation
- Role and group management supports organizational structure

## Stories

### Story 1: User Management & Authentication
- **Description**: Complete user lifecycle management with local authentication and MFA
- **Key requirements**: FR-IAM-1, user CRUD operations, password management, MFA
- **Integration**: Database storage, security utilities, audit logging

### Story 2: External Identity Provider Integration
- **Description**: Integration with OIDC, SAML, and LDAP providers for enterprise authentication
- **Key requirements**: FR-IAM-2, provider configuration, user synchronization
- **Integration**: External provider APIs, user mapping, session management

### Story 3: Group & Role Management
- **Description**: Implement group-based access control and role assignment for organizational structure
- **Key requirements**: Group management, role definitions, inheritance model
- **Integration**: User management, policy engine, organization hierarchy

## Requirements Coverage

**Functional Requirements:**
- ✅ FR-IAM-1: User management (create, update, delete)
- ✅ FR-IAM-2: Authentication with external providers
- ✅ FR-IAM-2.1: Simplified configuration for common providers
- ✅ FR-IAM-2.2: Token-based authentication support
- ✅ FR-013: Comprehensive audit logging for security events
- ✅ HRN generation for users and groups

**Security Requirements:**
- ✅ MFA support for enhanced security
- ✅ Secure session management
- ✅ Password policies and encryption
- ✅ Audit trail for all authentication events

## Dependencies

### Must Complete Before:
- None (can be developed in parallel with core features)

### Integration Dependencies:
- Policy engine for authorization decisions
- Organization management for hierarchical structure
- All bounded contexts requiring access control

### External Dependencies:
- OIDC provider libraries (Google, GitHub, Azure AD)
- SAML provider integration
- LDAP directory services

## Risk Assessment

### Primary Risks:
- **Security**: Authentication system is critical for overall system security
- **Complexity**: Multiple identity provider integration
- **User Experience**: Balancing security with usability

### Mitigation Strategies:
- Security-first design with comprehensive testing
- Incremental provider implementation
- User experience research and testing

### Rollback Plan:
- Fallback to local authentication only
- Preserve existing user data
- Disable external integrations if issues arise

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All three stories completed with full acceptance criteria
- [ ] User management working with full lifecycle support
- [ ] At least 3 major identity providers integrated and tested
- [ ] MFA implementation working correctly
- [ ] Token-based authentication for API access
- [ ] Group and role management functional
- [ ] Comprehensive security testing completed
- [ ] Performance testing under authentication load
- [ ] Documentation for user management and configuration

## Success Metrics

- **Authentication Success Rate**: > 99.5%
- **MFA Adoption Rate**: > 80% for privileged users
- **Identity Provider Integration**: All major providers working
- **User Management Performance**: p99 latency < 100ms
- **Security Audit Coverage**: 100% of authentication events
