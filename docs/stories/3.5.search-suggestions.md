# Story 3.5: Search Suggestions

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** intelligent search suggestions and auto-completion,
**so that** I can quickly find what I'm looking for with fewer keystrokes and discover relevant content.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. ✅ Users receive real-time search suggestions as they type
2. ✅ Suggestions include artifact names, versions, and relevant metadata
3. ✅ Auto-completion supports fuzzy matching and typo tolerance
4. ✅ Suggestions are ranked by relevance and popularity
5. ✅ Performance meets <2ms latency for suggestion generation
6. ✅ Integration with existing search infrastructure
7. ✅ Proper error handling for suggestion query processing
8. ✅ Comprehensive test coverage for suggestion scenarios
9. ✅ Support for multilingual text in suggestions
10. ✅ Integration with search analytics for suggestion optimization

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Implement FST-based autocomplete engine (AC: 1,2,3,4)
- [ ] Create suggestion ranking algorithm (AC: 4)
- [ ] Add fuzzy matching and typo tolerance (AC: 3)
- [ ] Integrate with basic search endpoints (AC: 6)
- [ ] Implement performance benchmarking for suggestions (AC: 5)
- [ ] Add comprehensive test suite for suggestion functionality (AC: 8)
- [ ] Implement error handling and validation (AC: 7)
- [ ] Add multilingual text processing for suggestions (AC: 9)
- [ ] Integrate with search analytics for optimization (AC: 10)

## Dev Notes
### Relevant Source Tree Info
- Search suggestion functionality located in `crates/search/src/features/search_suggestions/`
- FST implementation: `crates/search/src/features/search_suggestions/fst_engine.rs`
- Suggestion ranking: `crates/search/src/features/search_suggestions/ranking.rs`
- Integration: `crates/search/src/features/search_suggestions/integration.rs`

### Testing Standards
- Test file location: `crates/search/src/features/search_suggestions/search_suggestions_test.rs`
- Test both FST construction and suggestion generation
- Include performance testing for suggestion latency
- Test relevance ranking with various input types
- Use property-based testing for edge cases

### Implementation Patterns
- Use finite state transducers (FST) for efficient prefix matching
- Implement proper text analysis with language-specific tokenizers
- Follow existing dependency injection patterns
- Use structured logging for suggestion performance metrics
