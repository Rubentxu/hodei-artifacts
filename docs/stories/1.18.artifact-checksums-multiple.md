# Story 1.18: MÃºltiples Checksums para Artefactos

## Status

Draft

## Story

**As a** Developer using external tools,
**I want** the system to calculate and store multiple types of checksums (MD5, SHA-1, SHA-512) for each artifact in addition to the primary SHA-256 hash,
**so that** I can integrate with a wide variety of client tools and legacy systems that rely on different hashing algorithms.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. During artifact upload, the system must calculate MD5, SHA-1, and SHA-512 checksums in addition to SHA-256.
2. These additional checksums must be stored in the `PhysicalArtifact` model.
3. The calculation of multiple hashes should be done in parallel to minimize performance impact.
4. The API should allow clients to retrieve any of the calculated checksums for a given artifact.
5. The primary identifier and integrity check will still be based on SHA-256.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Modify the upload streaming logic to calculate multiple hashes in parallel.
- [ ] Update the `PhysicalArtifact` model to include a map for storing multiple checksums.
- [ ] Enhance the artifact metadata API to expose all available checksums.
- [ ] Write tests to verify the correctness of all calculated hashes against known values.
- [ ] Benchmark the performance impact of parallel hashing.

## Dev Notes

### Data Models
- `PhysicalArtifact.checksums`: A `HashMap<HashAlgorithm, String>` will be added to store the various checksums.

### Technical Constraints
- The parallel hashing implementation must be efficient and not become a bottleneck for high-speed uploads.
