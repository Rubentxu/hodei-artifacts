# Story 3.15: Search Personalization

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** frequent user,
**I want** personalized search results based on my preferences and usage patterns,
**so that** I can find relevant artifacts more quickly and efficiently.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. ✅ Search results are personalized based on user preferences
2. ✅ Personalization considers user search history and behavior patterns
3. ✅ Users can configure personalization settings and preferences
4. ✅ Personalization algorithms provide measurable relevance improvements
5. ✅ Personalization integrates with existing search ranking system
6. ✅ Performance impact of personalization is minimal (<10ms latency increase)
7. ✅ Proper privacy controls for user data used in personalization
8. ✅ Comprehensive test coverage for personalization scenarios
9. ✅ Support for opt-out of personalization features
10. ✅ Integration with user profile and preference management

## Tasks / Subtasks
