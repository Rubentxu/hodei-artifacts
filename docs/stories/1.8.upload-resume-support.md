# Story 1.8: Soporte para Reanudar Subidas

## Status

Draft

## Story

**As a** Developer or CI/CD system with an unstable connection,
**I want** to resume an interrupted artifact upload from the point where it failed,
**so that** I don't have to re-upload the entire file from the beginning, saving time and bandwidth.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. The system must support resumable uploads, likely using a protocol like TUS or by implementing a custom chunk-based mechanism.
2. When an upload starts, the server should provide a unique upload ID.
3. The client can use this ID to upload chunks of the file.
4. The client can query the server to find out which chunks have been successfully received.
5. If the connection is lost, the client can use the upload ID to resume by sending the remaining chunks.
6. The server will be responsible for re-assembling the chunks into the complete file once all are received.
7. Incomplete uploads should be garbage collected after a configurable timeout.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Choose and implement a resumable upload protocol (e.g., TUS).
- [ ] Implement server-side logic to manage upload sessions and received chunks.
- [ ] Create endpoints for initiating, performing, and querying the status of resumable uploads.
- [ ] Implement the final assembly of the artifact once all chunks are uploaded.
- [ ] Develop a garbage collection mechanism for expired/abandoned uploads.
- [ ] Write extensive tests for interruption and resumption scenarios.

## Dev Notes

### Technical Constraints
- This introduces stateful complexity to the upload process. A robust mechanism for managing partial uploads (e.g., using Redis or a database) is required.
- This feature is a significant enhancement to the simple multipart streaming in Story 1.2.
