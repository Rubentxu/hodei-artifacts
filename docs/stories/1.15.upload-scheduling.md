# Story 1.15: Programaci√≥n de Subidas

## Status

Draft

## Story

**As a** Developer or CI/CD System,
**I want** to schedule an artifact upload to occur at a specific time in the future,
**so that** I can align publications with maintenance windows or coordinated release schedules.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. The system must provide an API to schedule an artifact upload for a future date and time.
2. The artifact data should be uploaded and stored in a temporary, "pending" state.
3. A scheduling service must trigger the actual publication of the artifact at the specified time.
4. When the scheduled time arrives, the artifact is moved from the pending state to its final repository, and all standard post-upload logic (validation, events, etc.) is triggered.
5. Users must be able to list, view, and cancel their scheduled uploads.
6. An `ArtifactUploadScheduled` event should be published when the upload is first scheduled.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Design a system for storing pending artifacts and their scheduled publication times.
- [ ] Implement a scheduling service (e.g., using a job queue like `tokio-cron-scheduler`).
- [ ] Create API endpoints for scheduling, viewing, and canceling uploads.
- [ ] Implement the worker logic that performs the publication at the scheduled time.
- [ ] Write tests for the scheduling and cancellation logic.

## Dev Notes

### Technical Constraints
- The scheduling system must be reliable and persistent across application restarts.
- Time zones must be handled correctly.
