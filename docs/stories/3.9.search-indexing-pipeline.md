# Story 3.9: Search Indexing Pipeline

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** system administrator,
**I want** a real-time search indexing pipeline,
**so that** artifacts are immediately searchable after upload and the search index stays current with all repository changes.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. ✅ Implement event-driven indexing from Kafka events
2. ✅ Support real-time indexing with <1s latency from upload to search availability
3. ✅ Handle indexing failures with retry mechanisms and dead-letter queues
4. ✅ Support full reindexing of all artifacts when needed
5. ✅ Include proper monitoring and metrics for indexing performance
6. ✅ Implement incremental indexing for updates and deletions
7. ✅ Support distributed indexing across multiple instances
8. ✅ Provide comprehensive test coverage for indexing scenarios
9. ✅ Include proper error handling and recovery mechanisms
10. ✅ Support different indexing strategies (immediate, batch, scheduled)

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Create Kafka consumer for artifact events (AC: 1)
- [ ] Implement real-time indexing processor (AC: 2)
- [ ] Add retry mechanisms with exponential backoff (AC: 3)
- [ ] Create full reindexing capability (AC: 4)
- [ ] Add monitoring and metrics for indexing (AC: 5)
- [ ] Implement incremental update handling (AC: 6)
- [ ] Support distributed coordination for indexing (AC: 7)
- [ ] Create comprehensive test suite (AC: 8)
- [ ] Add error handling and recovery (AC: 9)
- [ ] Implement multiple indexing strategies (AC: 10)

## Dev Notes
### Relevant Source Tree Info
- Indexing pipeline located in `crates/search/src/features/indexing_pipeline/`
- Kafka integration: `crates/search/src/features/indexing_pipeline/kafka_consumer.rs`
- Indexing processor: `crates/search/src/features/indexing_pipeline/processor.rs`
- Distributed coordination: `crates/search/src/features/indexing_pipeline/distributed.rs`

### Testing Standards
- Test file location: `crates/search/src/features/indexing_pipeline/indexing_pipeline_test.rs`
- Test both real-time and batch indexing scenarios
- Include performance testing for indexing latency
- Test failure scenarios and recovery mechanisms
- Use property-based testing for edge cases

### Implementation Patterns
- Use Kafka for event-driven architecture
- Implement retry patterns with exponential backoff
- Use Redis for distributed coordination
- Follow existing async/await patterns in Rust
- Use structured logging for indexing events
