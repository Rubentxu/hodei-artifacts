# Story 3.1: Basic Search Engine

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to search for artifacts by name and version,
**so that** I can quickly find the specific artifacts I need for my projects.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. ✅ Users can search for artifacts by exact name match
2. ✅ Users can search for artifacts by version number
3. ✅ Search results are returned within <50ms latency p99
4. ✅ Search queries are case-insensitive for better usability
5. ✅ Empty search returns all artifacts with proper pagination
6. ✅ Search results include basic artifact metadata (name, version, type, repository)
7. ✅ Search API supports both GET and POST requests
8. ✅ Search results are properly formatted in JSON response
9. ✅ Search endpoint includes proper OpenAPI documentation
10. ✅ Search functionality integrates with existing authentication system

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Implement search endpoint in API layer (AC: 7,9)
- [ ] Create search use case with basic text matching (AC: 1,2,3)
- [ ] Integrate with Tantivy search index (AC: 3,6)
- [ ] Add case-insensitive search normalization (AC: 4)
- [ ] Implement pagination for search results (AC: 5)
- [ ] Add search result metadata formatting (AC: 6,8)
- [ ] Create OpenAPI documentation for search endpoint (AC: 9)
- [ ] Add authentication middleware to search endpoint (AC: 10)
- [ ] Write unit tests for search functionality (All AC)
- [ ] Write integration tests for search API (All AC)

## Dev Notes
### Relevant Source Tree Info
- Search functionality located in `crates/search/src/features/basic_search/`
- API endpoint: `crates/api_http/src/routes/search.rs`
- Use case: `crates/search/src/features/basic_search/use_case.rs`
- Tantivy integration: `crates/search/src/infra/tantivy_adapter.rs`

### Testing Standards
- Test file location: `crates/search/src/features/basic_search/basic_search_test.rs`
- Use `tracing` for test logging and assertions
- Test both happy path and error scenarios
- Include performance testing for latency requirements
- Mock external dependencies for unit tests
- Use testcontainers for integration tests

### Implementation Patterns
- Follow Vertical Slice Architecture pattern
- Use async/await for all I/O operations
- Implement proper error handling with feature-specific errors
- Use structured logging with tracing spans
- Follow existing dependency injection patterns
