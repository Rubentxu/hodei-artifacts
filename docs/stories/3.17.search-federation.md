# Story 3.17: Search Federation

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to search across multiple repositories simultaneously,
**so that** I can find artifacts across different repository boundaries without manual switching.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. ✅ Users can search across multiple repositories in a single query
2. ✅ Search results are merged and ranked consistently across repositories
3. ✅ Federation supports different repository types (hosted, proxy, virtual)
4. ✅ Performance meets latency requirements for federated searches
5. ✅ Error handling for partial failures in federated search
6. ✅ Configuration system for defining federated search groups
7. ✅ Support for repository-specific search parameters and filters
8. ✅ Comprehensive test coverage for federated search scenarios
9. ✅ Integration with existing search infrastructure and analytics
10. ✅ Support for cross-repository deduplication and result merging

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Implement federated search orchestration (AC: 1,2)
- [ ] Add repository group configuration system (AC: 6)
- [ ] Create result merging and ranking algorithm (AC: 2,10)
- [ ] Implement error handling for partial federation failures (AC: 5)
- [ ] Add performance optimization for federated queries (AC: 4)
- [ ] Create comprehensive test suite for federation (AC: 8)
- [ ] Integrate with existing search endpoints (AC: 9)
- [ ] Add repository-specific parameter handling (AC: 7)
- [ ] Implement cross-repository deduplication (AC: 10)
- [ ] Add monitoring for federated search performance

## Dev Notes
### Relevant Source Tree Info
- Federation functionality located in `crates/search/src/features/federation/`
- Orchestration implementation: `crates/search/src/features/federation/orchestration.rs`
- Result merging: `crates/search/src/features/federation/merging.rs`
- Configuration: `crates/search/src/features/federation/config.rs`

### Testing Standards
- Test file location: `crates/search/src/features/federation/federation_test.rs`
- Test both successful and partial failure scenarios
- Include performance testing for federated queries
- Test result merging and ranking consistency
- Use property-based testing for edge cases

### Implementation Patterns
- Use async parallelism for concurrent repository queries
- Implement circuit breaker pattern for repository failures
- Use consistent hashing for result deduplication
- Follow existing dependency injection patterns
- Use structured logging for federation performance metrics
