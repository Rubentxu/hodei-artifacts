# Story 3.6: Search Analytics

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** product manager,
**I want** detailed analytics on search queries and user behavior,
**so that** I can understand usage patterns, optimize search performance, and make data-driven decisions.

## Acceptance Criteria

2. ✅ Generate metrics on popular search terms and patterns
3. ✅ Provide real-time analytics dashboard for search performance
4. ✅ Support trend analysis and anomaly detection for search queries
5. ✅ Integrate with existing monitoring and alerting systems
6. ✅ Ensure data privacy and compliance with retention policies
7. ✅ Export analytics data in multiple formats (CSV, JSON)
8. ✅ Comprehensive test coverage for analytics collection and processing
9. ✅ Support for custom analytics reports and visualizations
10. ✅ Performance meets <100ms latency for analytics queries
