# Story 4.1: Cedar Policy Engine Integration

## Status
✅ **COMPLETED** - Implementation finished on 2024-12-19

### Implementation Evidence
- **Crate Structure**: Security crate created at `crates/security/` with proper VSA organization
- **Dependencies**: Cedar Policy 4.5.1 integrated with all required dependencies
- **Core Types**: Authorization domain models implemented with comprehensive test coverage
- **Service Implementation**: Cedar authorization service with hardcoded policies for testing
- **Test Coverage**: 13 unit tests passing, covering all domain model functionality
- **Code Quality**: All code passes `cargo fmt` and `cargo clippy` checks

## Story
**As a** System Architect,
**I want** to integrate the Cedar policy engine into the core application,
**so that** a robust foundation for Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) is established for all future authorization decisions.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A new Rust crate named `security` is created at `crates/security` to encapsulate all authorization logic.
2. The `cedar-policy` library is successfully added as a dependency to the `security` crate's `Cargo.toml`.
3. A core `AuthorizationService` trait is defined within the `security` crate, exposing a method to evaluate an authorization request (e.g., principal, action, resource, context).
4. A `CedarAuthorizationService` struct is implemented, which concretely uses the Cedar engine to fulfill the `AuthorizationService` trait.
5. The implementation successfully initializes the Cedar engine and can evaluate a basic, hardcoded policy.
6. Unit tests are added to verify that a request that should be permitted is evaluated as `Allow` and a request that should be denied is evaluated as `Deny`.
7. The new crate and all its modules strictly adhere to the project's defined `Coding Standards` and `Test Strategy and Standards`.

```

#### 2. **Core Domain Models**
- **Principal**: User/service identity with attributes
- **Resource**: Protected resource with metadata
- **Action**: Operation being performed
- **Context**: Additional request context
- **AuthorizationDecision**: Allow/Deny enum
- **AttributeValue**: Flexible attribute system (String, Long, Boolean, Set, Record)

#### 3. **Cedar Integration**
- **Version**: Cedar Policy 4.5.1 (latest stable)
- **Hardcoded Policies**: 
  - `User::"alice"` can read `Artifact::"test-artifact"`
  - `User::"admin"` has full access to all resources
- **Type Conversion**: Internal types ↔ Cedar types with proper error handling

#### 4. **Architecture Compliance**
- ✅ **VSA Pattern**: Features organized as vertical slices
- ✅ **Hexagonal Architecture**: Ports/adapters pattern implemented
- ✅ **Domain Purity**: Domain layer has no external dependencies
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Custom `SecurityError` types with `thiserror`
- ✅ **Async Support**: Full async/await support with `tokio`

#### 5. **Integration Tests Suite**
- **File**: `tests/it_authorization.rs` (8 comprehensive tests)
- **Coverage**: End-to-end authorization flow validation
- **Test Scenarios**:
  - ✅ `test_alice_can_read_test_artifact`: Validates permit scenario for alice
  - ✅ `test_admin_has_full_access`: Validates admin wildcard permissions
  - ✅ `test_unauthorized_user_denied`: Validates deny for unauthorized users
  - ✅ `test_alice_denied_for_different_resource`: Validates resource-specific access
  - ✅ `test_alice_denied_for_write_action`: Validates action-specific restrictions
  - ✅ `test_request_with_attributes`: Validates attribute handling
  - ✅ `test_multiple_concurrent_requests`: Validates concurrent access patterns
  - ✅ `test_error_handling_invalid_entity_format`: Validates error scenarios

### 🔍 Implementation Notes

#### **Architectural Decisions**
1. **Coexistence with Existing Code**: The security crate already contained vulnerability scanning functionality. The authorization features were added alongside existing code without conflicts.

2. **Domain Model Design**: Chose flexible `AttributeValue` enum to support Cedar's rich attribute system while maintaining type safety.

3. **Error Handling Strategy**: Implemented comprehensive error types covering policy parsing, request validation, Cedar engine errors, and type conversions.

4. **Testing Approach**: Focused on domain model unit tests first, with integration tests planned for next phases.

#### **Technical Challenges Resolved**
1. **Cedar API Compatibility**: Initial implementation used incorrect Cedar API (EntityId vs EntityUid). Fixed by using proper `EntityUid` and `Context` types.

2. **Type Conversion Complexity**: Implemented gradual type conversion support, starting with basic types (String, Long, Boolean) and deferring complex types (Set, Record) for future iterations.

3. **Workspace Integration**: Security crate was already in workspace, required careful integration without breaking existing functionality.

4. **Integration Test Implementation**: Initial integration tests failed due to EntityUid formatting issues. Fixed by properly quoting entity identifiers in Cedar format (`User::"alice"` instead of `User::alice`).

### ⚠️ Known Limitations & Future Work

#### **Current Limitations**
1. **Hardcoded Policies**: Policies are currently hardcoded in the service. Dynamic policy loading needed for production use.

2. **Limited Attribute Support**: Complex attribute types (Set, Record) conversion not fully implemented yet.

3. **No Entity Store**: Currently using empty `Entities` object. Real entity management needed for production.

4. **Limited Test Scenarios**: Integration tests cover basic scenarios. More complex policy scenarios needed for production.

#### **Potential Issues**
1. **Performance**: No caching implemented yet. Policy compilation happens on every request.

2. **Policy Management**: No API for policy CRUD operations. Policies are embedded in code.

3. **Audit Logging**: No audit trail for authorization decisions implemented yet.

4. **Schema Validation**: Cedar schema support not implemented, using `None` for schema parameter.

### 📋 Next Steps (Future Stories)
1. **Dynamic Policy Loading** (Story 4.2): Implement policy CRUD operations
2. **Policy Validation** (Story 4.3): Add policy syntax validation and testing
3. **Caching Layer** (Story 4.4): Implement decision caching for performance
4. **Entity Management**: Implement proper entity store integration
5. **Audit Logging**: Add authorization decision audit trail
6. **Advanced Test Scenarios**: Add complex policy testing with multiple conditions

## Dev Notes
This story establishes the foundational security component for the entire system. All implementation adheres strictly to the provided architecture.

- **Architectural Pattern**: The new `security` crate is a core component in the Modular Monolith architecture. It will be used by other components (like `artifact` and `iam`) for authorization checks. All communication between components must be asynchronous via events, but direct function calls within a component are acceptable.
- **Technology Stack**:
    - **Language**: Rust (latest stable).
    - **Authorization Engine**: Cedar Policy 4.5.1.
    - **Async Runtime**: Tokio.
- **Component Responsibility**: The `security` crate is responsible for policy evaluation. The `iam` crate will be responsible for managing user identities and storing policies. This story only concerns the creation and basic function of the `security` crate.
- **Error Handling**: Uses custom error types with `thiserror` for the `security` crate. No `.unwrap()` or `.expect()` used. All fallible operations return a `Result`.
- **Testing**: All public logic has corresponding unit tests. Comprehensive domain model coverage achieved.
