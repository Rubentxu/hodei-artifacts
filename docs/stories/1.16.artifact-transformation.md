# Story 1.16: Transformaci√≥n de Artefactos

## Status

Draft

## Story

**As a** System Administrator,
**I want** to configure rules that automatically transform artifacts during the upload process,
**so that** I can enforce standards or enrich artifacts without client-side changes.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. The system must support defining transformation rules on a per-repository basis.
2. An example transformation would be to automatically generate and inject a standard `README.md` file into an uploaded ZIP archive if it's missing.
3. Another example is converting an uploaded image to a standard format or size.
4. Transformations should occur after the initial upload but before the final `ArtifactUploaded` event is published.
5. The transformation results in a *new* `PhysicalArtifact` with a new hash; the original is discarded or archived.
6. An `ArtifactTransformed` event should be published, indicating the original and new artifact hashes.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Design a pluggable architecture for transformation handlers.
- [ ] Implement the transformation pipeline within the upload workflow.
- [ ] Create a sample transformer for injecting a file into a ZIP archive.
- [ ] Create a sample transformer for image resizing.
- [ ] Implement the configuration for associating transformers with repositories.
- [ ] Publish the `ArtifactTransformed` event.

## Dev Notes

### Technical Constraints
- Transformations can be computationally expensive and should be handled in a way that doesn't block the main application threads, possibly using a worker model.
- Security is paramount: transformation logic must be sandboxed to prevent exploits.
