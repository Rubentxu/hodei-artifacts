# Story 3.20: Search Monitoring

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** system administrator,
**I want** comprehensive monitoring of search performance and health,
**so that** I can ensure search service reliability and identify performance issues proactively.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. ✅ Real-time search performance metrics collection and visualization
2. ✅ Health checks for search service components (indexing, query processing, cache)
3. ✅ Alerting for performance degradation and service outages
4. ✅ Historical performance data retention and trend analysis
5. ✅ Integration with existing monitoring infrastructure (Prometheus, Grafana)
6. ✅ Customizable dashboards for different stakeholder views
7. ✅ Performance meets requirements for monitoring data collection
8. ✅ Comprehensive test coverage for monitoring functionality
9. ✅ Support for distributed tracing of search requests
10. ✅ Integration with existing logging and alerting systems

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Integrate with existing logging and alerting infrastructure (AC: 10)
- [ ] Create monitoring documentation and runbooks

## Dev Notes
### Relevant Source Tree Info
- Search monitoring functionality located in `crates/search/src/features/monitoring/`
- Metrics collection: `crates/search/src/features/monitoring/metrics.rs`
- Health checks: `crates/search/src/features/monitoring/health.rs`
- Alerting integration: `crates/search/src/features/monitoring/alerting.rs`
- Dashboard configuration: `crates/search/src/features/monitoring/dashboards.rs`

### Testing Standards
- Test file location: `crates/search/src/features/monitoring/monitoring_test.rs`
- Test metrics collection accuracy and performance
- Include health check validation tests
- Test alerting rule evaluation and notification
- Use property-based testing for edge cases

### Implementation Patterns
- Use Prometheus metrics with custom collectors
- Implement health checks with circuit breaker pattern
- Use structured logging for monitoring events
- Follow existing async/await patterns for metric collection
- Implement distributed tracing with OpenTelemetry
