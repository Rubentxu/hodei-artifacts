# Story 3.13: Search by Vulnerability

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** security engineer,
**I want** to search for artifacts by their vulnerability status,
**so that** I can identify and manage artifacts with security vulnerabilities efficiently.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. ✅ Users can search for artifacts using exact vulnerability matching (CVE IDs)
2. ✅ Search supports multiple vulnerability severity levels (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
3. ✅ Vulnerability search results include artifact metadata and security status
4. ✅ Search performance meets <50ms latency p99 for vulnerability lookups
5. ✅ Vulnerability indexing is automatically maintained during security scans
6. ✅ Search integrates with existing search functionality and APIs
7. ✅ Proper error handling for invalid vulnerability formats
8. ✅ Comprehensive test coverage for vulnerability search scenarios
9. ✅ Support for vulnerability severity filtering
10. ✅ Integration with vulnerability database systems

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Implement vulnerability indexing during security scans (AC: 5)
- [ ] Create vulnerability search endpoint with exact matching (AC: 1,2)
- [ ] Add vulnerability severity filtering support (AC: 9)
- [ ] Integrate vulnerability search with existing search infrastructure (AC: 6)
- [ ] Implement performance benchmarking for vulnerability lookups (AC: 4)
- [ ] Add comprehensive test suite for vulnerability search (AC: 8)
- [ ] Implement vulnerability validation and error handling (AC: 7)
- [ ] Add security status to search results (AC: 3,10)
- [ ] Create documentation for vulnerability search API usage

## Dev Notes
### Relevant Source Tree Info
- Vulnerability search functionality located in `crates/search/src/features/vulnerability_search/`
- Vulnerability indexing: `crates/search/src/features/vulnerability_search/indexing.rs`
- Search implementation: `crates/search/src/features/vulnerability_search/search.rs`
- Integration: `crates/search/src/features/vulnerability_search/integration.rs`

### Testing Standards
- Test file location: `crates/search/src/features/vulnerability_search/vulnerability_search_test.rs`
- Test exact vulnerability matching with various CVE IDs
- Include performance testing for vulnerability lookup latency
- Test vulnerability validation and error cases
- Use property-based testing for edge cases

### Implementation Patterns
- Use Tantivy's exact term matching for vulnerability searches
- Implement vulnerability normalization and validation using CVE standards
- Follow existing async/await patterns in Rust
- Use structured logging for vulnerability search performance metrics
- Integrate with security scanning results for vulnerability status
