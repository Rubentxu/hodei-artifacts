# Story 3.22: Search ML Recommendations

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** machine learning-based search recommendations,
**so that** I can discover relevant artifacts based on my search history and preferences.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. ✅ ML-based recommendation engine provides personalized search suggestions
2. ✅ Recommendations based on user search history and artifact interactions
3. ✅ Multiple recommendation algorithms supported (collaborative filtering, content-based)
4. ✅ Recommendation quality meets >80% relevance accuracy
5. ✅ Performance meets <100ms latency for recommendation generation
6. ✅ Integration with existing search and user profile systems
7. ✅ Comprehensive test coverage for recommendation algorithms
8. ✅ Support for A/B testing of different recommendation strategies
9. ✅ Model training and evaluation pipeline implemented
10. ✅ Integration with search analytics for continuous improvement
