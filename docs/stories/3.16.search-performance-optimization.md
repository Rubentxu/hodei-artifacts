# Story 3.16: Search Performance Optimization

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** system administrator,
**I want** optimized search performance with minimal latency,
**so that** users experience fast search responses even under heavy load.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. ✅ Search latency meets p99 <50ms requirement for typical queries
2. ✅ Index optimization techniques implemented for faster queries
3. ✅ Query optimization pipeline reduces unnecessary computations
4. ✅ Caching strategies implemented for frequent queries and results
5. ✅ Memory usage optimized for search index operations
6. ✅ Performance monitoring and metrics collection implemented
7. ✅ Automatic index maintenance and optimization scheduled
8. ✅ Comprehensive performance testing and benchmarking
9. ✅ Integration with existing search infrastructure
10. ✅ Support for horizontal scaling of search performance

## Dev Notes
### Relevant Source Tree Info
- Performance optimization functionality located in `crates/search/src/features/performance_optimization/`
- Index optimization: `crates/search/src/features/performance_optimization/index_optimization.rs`
- Query optimization: `crates/search/src/features/performance_optimization/query_optimization.rs`
- Caching implementation: `crates/search/src/features/performance_optimization/caching.rs`

### Testing Standards
- Test file location: `crates/search/src/features/performance_optimization/performance_optimization_test.rs`
- Test performance under various load conditions
- Include benchmark testing for latency and throughput
- Test caching effectiveness and hit rates
