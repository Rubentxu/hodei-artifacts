# Story 3.11: Search by Hash

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** security engineer,
**I want** to search for artifacts by their SHA-256 checksum,
**so that** I can quickly verify artifact integrity and detect potential tampering.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. ✅ Users can search for artifacts using exact SHA-256 hash matching
2. ✅ Search supports multiple hash algorithms (SHA-256, SHA-1, MD5)
3. ✅ Hash search results include artifact metadata and verification status
4. ✅ Search performance meets <10ms latency p99 for hash lookups
5. ✅ Hash indexing is automatically maintained during artifact upload
6. ✅ Search integrates with existing search functionality and APIs
7. ✅ Proper error handling for invalid hash formats
8. ✅ Comprehensive test coverage for hash search scenarios
9. ✅ Support for hash prefix matching (partial hash search)
10. ✅ Integration with security scanning and verification systems

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Implement hash indexing during artifact upload (AC: 5)
- [ ] Create hash search endpoint with exact matching (AC: 1,2)
- [ ] Add hash prefix matching support (AC: 9)
- [ ] Integrate hash search with existing search infrastructure (AC: 6)
- [ ] Implement performance benchmarking for hash lookups (AC: 4)
- [ ] Add comprehensive test suite for hash search (AC: 8)
- [ ] Implement hash validation and error handling (AC: 7)
- [ ] Add security verification status to search results (AC: 3,10)
- [ ] Create documentation for hash search API usage

## Dev Notes
### Relevant Source Tree Info
- Hash search functionality located in `crates/search/src/features/hash_search/`
- Hash indexing: `crates/search/src/features/hash_search/indexing.rs`
- Search implementation: `crates/search/src/features/hash_search/search.rs`
- Integration: `crates/search/src/features/hash_search/integration.rs`

### Testing Standards
- Test file location: `crates/search/src/features/hash_search/hash_search_test.rs`
- Test exact hash matching with various algorithms
