# Story 1.6: Seguimiento del Progreso de Subida

## Status

Draft

## Story

**As a** Developer using the UI or a CI/CD System,
**I want** to track the real-time progress of my artifact uploads,
**so that** I can monitor the status and estimate the completion time, especially for large files.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. The system must provide a mechanism to query the progress of an ongoing upload.
2. This could be via a separate endpoint or a WebSocket connection.
3. The progress should include bytes transferred and total file size.
4. The frontend should display a progress bar for uploads initiated from the UI.
5. An `UploadProgressUpdated` event should be published internally to facilitate this.
6. The tracking mechanism should be secure and only allow the uploader to see the progress.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Design the progress tracking mechanism (e.g., WebSocket vs. polling endpoint).
- [ ] Implement the `UploadProgressUpdated` event emission during the streaming upload process.
- [ ] Create a service to manage and broadcast progress updates.
- [ ] Secure the progress tracking endpoint/channel.
- [ ] Implement a progress bar component in the frontend.
- [ ] Write tests for the progress tracking functionality.

## Dev Notes

### API Specifications
- **New Endpoint/Channel**: `GET /uploads/{upload_id}/progress` or a WebSocket at `ws /uploads/progress`.
- The `upload_id` would be generated and returned when the upload is initiated.

### Technical Constraints
- The progress reporting should not add significant overhead to the upload process.
- The solution must scale to handle many concurrent uploads.
