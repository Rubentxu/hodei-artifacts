# Story 3.2: Advanced Query Parser

## Status
Completed ✅

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to use advanced query syntax for searching artifacts,
**so that** I can perform complex searches based on specific properties and metadata.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. ✅ Users can search using field-specific syntax (e.g., "name:artifact* version:1.2.*")
2. ✅ Query parser supports boolean operators (AND, OR, NOT)
3. ✅ Query validation provides meaningful error messages for invalid syntax
4. ✅ Parser supports range queries for numeric fields (e.g., "size:[1000 TO 5000]")
5. ✅ Wildcard and fuzzy search support in field-specific queries
6. ✅ Query parsing performance meets <10ms latency p99
7. ✅ Parser integrates with existing search infrastructure
8. ✅ Comprehensive test coverage for query parsing scenarios
9. ✅ Proper error handling and validation feedback
10. ✅ Support for grouping with parentheses for complex expressions

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Implement advanced query parser with field-specific syntax (AC: 1,2,4,5,10)
- [x] Create query validation and error reporting system (AC: 3,9)
- [x] Integrate parser with Tantivy search backend (AC: 7)
- [x] Add performance benchmarking for query parsing (AC: 6)
- [x] Implement comprehensive test suite (AC: 8)
- [x] Create OpenAPI documentation for advanced query syntax (AC: 3)
- [x] Add query parsing metrics and monitoring (AC: 6)
- [x] Implement query transformation to Tantivy query DSL (AC: 7)

## Dev Notes
### Relevant Source Tree Info
- Query parsing functionality located in `crates/search/src/features/advanced_query/`
- Parser implementation: `crates/search/src/features/advanced_query/parser.rs`
- Integration: `crates/search/src/features/advanced_query/integration.rs`
- Error types: `crates/search/src/features/advanced_query/error.rs`

### Testing Standards
- Test file location: `crates/search/src/features/advanced_query/advanced_query_test.rs`
- Test both valid and invalid query scenarios
- Include performance testing for parsing latency
- Test integration with Tantivy query generation
- Use property-based testing for query validation

### Implementation Patterns
- Use parser combinators (nom) for query parsing
- Implement proper error recovery and reporting
- Follow existing dependency injection patterns
- Use structured logging for query parsing events

## Implementation Notes
### Architecture
The implementation follows the Vertical Slice Architecture (VSA) pattern with Clean Architecture principles:

```
crates/search/src/features/advanced_query/
├── mod.rs              # Module exports
├── parser.rs           # Advanced query parser using nom
├── integration.rs      # Integration with Tantivy search backend
├── error.rs            # Custom error types
├── dto.rs              # Data transfer objects
├── advanced_query_test.rs  # Unit tests
└── test_utils.rs       # Test utilities and mocks
```

### Key Features Implemented
1. **Field-specific queries**: `name:artifact* version:1.2.*`
2. **Boolean operators**: `AND`, `OR`, `NOT` (also `&&`, `||`, `!`)
3. **Quoted values**: `"exact phrase"`
4. **Wildcards**: `*` and `?`
5. **Fuzzy matching**: `~`
6. **Range queries**: `[1000 TO 5000]`
7. **Grouping**: Parentheses for complex expressions

### Performance
- **Parsing latency**: <10ms p99 (requirement met)
- **Memory usage**: Efficient resource utilization
- **Concurrency**: Supports high-concurrency query processing

### Security Considerations
- **Query sanitization**: Prevention of injection attacks
- **Complexity limits**: Protection against denial-of-service
- **Resource constraints**: Memory and CPU usage limitations
- **Input validation**: Thorough validation of all query components

## QA Results
✅ All acceptance criteria verified through testing
✅ Performance requirements met (<10ms parsing latency p99)
✅ Proper error handling implemented
✅ Comprehensive test coverage achieved
✅ Code quality maintained with all clippy warnings fixed

## Future Enhancements
### Short Term
1. Query optimization with rule-based optimization
2. Caching layer for frequently used parsed queries
3. Analytics for query usage statistics and performance monitoring

### Medium Term
1. Natural language processing for intent recognition
2. Query suggestions with intelligent auto-completion
3. Query history with user-specific query history and favorites

### Long Term
1. Machine learning for AI-powered query understanding and ranking
2. Personalization with custom ranking based on user behavior
3. Advanced features like query federation across multiple repositories
