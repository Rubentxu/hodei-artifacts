# Story 3.10: Search Result Ranking

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** search results to be ranked by relevance using customizable ranking algorithms,
**so that** I can find the most relevant artifacts quickly and efficiently.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. ✅ Implement BM25 scoring algorithm for relevance ranking
2. ✅ Support customizable ranking factors (downloads, recency, popularity, maintainer reputation)
3. ✅ Provide configurable ranking weights for different factors
4. ✅ Ensure ranking performance meets <10ms latency p99
5. ✅ Integrate ranking with existing search functionality
6. ✅ Support personalized ranking based on user preferences
7. ✅ Implement proper monitoring for ranking performance
8. ✅ Provide comprehensive test coverage for ranking scenarios
9. ✅ Support A/B testing for ranking algorithm improvements
10. ✅ Include proper error handling for ranking operations

## Dev Notes
### Relevant Source Tree Info
- Ranking functionality located in `crates/search/src/features/ranking/`
- BM25 implementation: `crates/search/src/features/ranking/bm25_scoring.rs`
- Custom factors: `crates/search/src/features/ranking/custom_factors.rs`
- Integration: `crates/search/src/features/ranking/integration.rs`

### Testing Standards
- Test file location: `crates/search/src/features/ranking/ranking_test.rs`
- Test ranking accuracy with various query types
- Include performance testing for ranking latency
- Test different ranking factor combinations
- Use property-based testing for edge cases

### Implementation Patterns
- Use Tantivy's scoring capabilities with custom boosts
- Implement configurable ranking weights via system configuration
- Follow existing async/await patterns in Rust
- Use structured logging for ranking performance metrics
