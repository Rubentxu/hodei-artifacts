# Story 1.9: LÃ³gica de Versionado de Artefactos

## Status

Draft

## Story

**As a** Repository Administrator,
**I want** the system to understand and enforce semantic versioning rules for artifacts,
**so that** I can maintain a clean, predictable, and well-organized repository.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. The system must parse the version string from the artifact's coordinates.
2. It should validate if the version follows Semantic Versioning (SemVer 2.0.0) standards.
3. The repository can be configured to reject non-SemVer versions.
4. The system should correctly handle pre-release tags (e.g., `1.0.0-alpha.1`) and build metadata (e.g., `1.0.0+build.123`).
5. The system should differentiate between SNAPSHOT and release versions, especially for Maven repositories.
6. Repository policies can be defined based on versioning (e.g., "Allow only one SNAPSHOT per major.minor version").

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Integrate a SemVer parsing library (e.g., the `semver` crate).
- [ ] Add version validation logic to the artifact upload workflow.
- [ ] Add repository-level configuration to enable/disable strict SemVer enforcement.
- [ ] Implement logic to handle SNAPSHOT versions.
- [ ] Write unit tests for parsing and validating a wide range of version strings.

## Dev Notes

### Data Models
- The `PackageCoordinates.version` field is the primary input for this story.
- The `Repository.config` might be extended to include versioning policies.
