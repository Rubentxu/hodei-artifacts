# Story 3.3: Full-Text Search

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to perform full-text search across artifact content and metadata,
**so that** I can find artifacts based on their actual content and comprehensive metadata.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. ✅ Users can search across all text fields including name, description, and metadata
2. ✅ Search supports stemming and tokenization for better relevance
3. ✅ Results are ranked by relevance using BM25 scoring algorithm
4. ✅ Search performance meets <50ms latency p99 for typical queries
5. ✅ Indexing includes all relevant text content from artifacts
6. ✅ Search integrates with existing basic search functionality
7. ✅ Proper error handling for search query processing
8. ✅ Comprehensive test coverage for full-text search scenarios
9. ✅ Support for multilingual text processing
10. ✅ Integration with existing search analytics and monitoring

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Implement full-text indexing for artifact content and metadata (AC: 1,5)
- [ ] Integrate BM25 scoring algorithm for relevance ranking (AC: 3)
- [ ] Add stemming and tokenization support (AC: 2,9)
- [ ] Create search integration with basic search endpoints (AC: 6)
- [ ] Implement performance benchmarking for full-text search (AC: 4)
- [ ] Add comprehensive test suite for full-text search (AC: 8)
- [ ] Implement error handling and validation (AC: 7)
- [ ] Add multilingual text processing capabilities (AC: 9)
- [ ] Integrate with search analytics and monitoring (AC: 10)

## Dev Notes
### Relevant Source Tree Info
- Full-text search functionality located in `crates/search/src/features/full_text_search/`
- Indexing implementation: `crates/search/src/features/full_text_search/indexing.rs`
- Search integration: `crates/search/src/features/full_text_search/integration.rs`
- BM25 scoring: `crates/search/src/features/full_text_search/scoring.rs`

### Testing Standards
- Test file location: `crates/search/src/features/full_text_search/full_text_search_test.rs`
- Test both indexing and search functionality
- Include performance testing for search latency
- Test relevance ranking with various query types
- Use property-based testing for edge cases

### Implementation Patterns
- Use Tantivy's full-text search capabilities with custom schema
- Implement proper text analysis with language-specific tokenizers
- Follow existing dependency injection patterns
- Use structured logging for search performance metrics
