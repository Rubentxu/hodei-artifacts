# Story 3.18: Search Alerts

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to receive notifications when new artifacts match my saved search criteria,
**so that** I can stay informed about relevant artifacts without manually checking.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. ✅ Users can create search alerts based on specific search criteria
2. ✅ Alert notifications are triggered when new artifacts match saved search criteria
3. ✅ Multiple notification channels supported (email, webhook, in-app)
4. ✅ Alert frequency and throttling configurable per alert
5. ✅ Users can manage (create, update, delete) their search alerts
6. ✅ Alert history and delivery status tracked
7. ✅ Performance meets requirements for real-time alert processing
8. ✅ Comprehensive test coverage for alert creation and triggering
9. ✅ Integration with existing search and notification infrastructure
10. ✅ Support for deduplication to prevent duplicate notifications

## Tasks / Subtasks

## Dev Notes
### Relevant Source Tree Info
- Search alerts functionality located in `crates/search/src/features/alerts/`
- Alert management: `crates/search/src/features/alerts/management.rs`
- Alert triggering: `crates/search/src/features/alerts/triggering.rs`
- Notification integration: `crates/search/src/features/alerts/notifications.rs`

### Testing Standards
- Test file location: `crates/search/src/features/alerts/alerts_test.rs`
- Test alert creation, triggering, and notification delivery
- Include performance testing for alert processing latency
- Test deduplication and throttling functionality
- Use property-based testing for edge cases

### Implementation Patterns
- Use Kafka for event-driven alert processing
- Implement Redis for alert state management and deduplication
- Follow existing async/await patterns in Rust
- Use structured logging for alert delivery metrics
- Implement circuit breaker pattern for notification services
