# 6. Quality Assurance

## 6.1 Code Quality Rules

* **Error-Free Compilation:** All crate code must compile without errors (`cargo check`)
* **Warning-Free Code:** All warnings must be resolved (`cargo clippy`)
* **Mandatory Tests:** All tests must pass (`cargo nextest run`)

## 6.2 Testing Strategy

* **Unit Testing:**
  * Focus on use cases and API logic
  * Mock all external dependencies
  * Test domain events emitted
  * Use tracing for internal behavior verification

* **Integration Testing:**
  * Use `testcontainers-rs` for SurrealDB and storage backends
  * Test real client interactions (Maven, npm)
  * Validate protocol compatibility

* **Load Testing:**
  * Locust for realistic traffic simulation
  * k6 for high-concurrency scenarios
  * Focus on critical paths (upload, download, metadata)

* **Security Testing:**
  * OWASP ZAP integration in CI
  * cargo-audit for Rust dependencies
  * Trivy for container scanning

## 6.3 Continuous Integration

* **Build Pipeline:**
  1. Run `cargo check` and `cargo clippy`
  2. Execute unit tests with `cargo nextest`
  3. Run integration tests with testcontainers
  4. Perform load and security testing
  5. Validate OpenAPI contract compliance

* **Quality Gates:**
  - Code coverage > 85% for critical paths
  - No high-severity security issues
  - All performance benchmarks met
  - No OpenAPI contract drift
