# Potential Challenges & Solutions

## Challenge 1: Scanner Performance
**Problem**: Vulnerability scanners can be slow for large artifacts
**Solution**:
- Implement incremental scanning
- Use result caching with TTL
- Provide progress reporting for long scans

## Challenge 2: False Positives
**Problem**: Vulnerability scanners may report false positives
**Solution**:
- Implement manual verification workflow
- Use multiple scanners for confirmation
- Provide false positive marking and filtering

## Challenge 3: Database Size
**Problem**: Vulnerability databases can grow very large
**Solution**:
- Implement database pruning for old vulnerabilities
- Use compressed storage formats
- Distribute database across multiple instances

## Challenge 4: License Complexity
**Problem**: License detection and compliance is complex
**Solution**:
- Use multiple license detection methods
- Implement manual override capability
- Provide comprehensive license policy management
