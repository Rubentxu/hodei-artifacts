# Unified Domain Model Alignment

## Overview
This document outlines the unified domain model alignment across all bounded contexts, merging the best practices from existing implementations with DDD patterns.

## Unified Architecture Pattern

### Core Principles
1. **Aggregate Roots**: Each bounded context has clear aggregate roots
2. **Value Objects**: Rich value objects for domain concepts
3. **Domain Events**: Event-driven architecture for state changes
4. **Repository Pattern**: Persistence abstraction
5. **Lifecycle Management**: Consistent lifecycle tracking
6. **Backward Compatibility**: Legacy structure conversion

### Common Patterns

#### Value Objects
- **HRN-based IDs**: All entities use HRN for unique identification
- **Rich Value Objects**: Encapsulate domain concepts with validation
- **Immutable by Default**: Value objects are immutable

#### Aggregate Roots
- **Business Logic**: Contains domain business rules
- **State Management**: Manages entity state transitions
- **Event Generation**: Emits domain events for state changes

#### Conversion Layer
- **Legacy Compatibility**: Seamless conversion between old and new models
- **Gradual Migration**: Support for gradual adoption
- **Zero-Downtime**: No breaking changes during migration

## Bounded Context Alignment

### 1. Artifact Bounded Context
**Aggregate Roots**: Artifact, PhysicalArtifact, Sbom
**Key Features**:
- Unified artifact lifecycle management
- Rich metadata support
- SBOM integration
- Physical artifact tracking
- Repository association

### 2. IAM Bounded Context
**Aggregate Roots**: User, Organization, Role, Permission
**Key Features**:
- Hierarchical permission system
- Organization membership
- Team management
- Role-based access control
- Audit trail

### 3. Repository Bounded Context
**Aggregate Roots**: Repository, Package, Version
**Key Features**:
- Multi-ecosystem support
- Package versioning
- Repository visibility controls
- Access management
- Storage backend abstraction

### 4. Organization Bounded Context
**Aggregate Roots**: Organization, Member, Team
**Key Features**:
- Hierarchical organization structure
- Team-based collaboration
- Member role management
- Repository ownership
- Cross-organization permissions

### 5. Supply-Chain Bounded Context
**Aggregate Roots**: SupplyChain, Vulnerability, License
**Key Features**:
- Dependency tracking
- Vulnerability management
- License compliance
- Security scanning
- Risk assessment

### 6. Distribution Bounded Context
**Aggregate Roots**: Distribution, Channel, Release
**Key Features**:
- Multi-channel distribution
- Release management
- Rollout strategies
- Geographic distribution
- CDN integration

### 7. Search Bounded Context
**Aggregate Roots**: SearchIndex, Document, Query
**Key Features**:
- Full-text search
- Faceted search
- Relevance scoring
- Real-time indexing
- Query optimization

### 8. Security Bounded Context
**Aggregate Roots**: SecurityPolicy, ScanResult, Certificate
**Key Features**:
- Security policy enforcement
- Scan result aggregation
- Certificate management
- Compliance reporting
- Threat detection

### 9. Policies Bounded Context
**Aggregate Roots**: Policy, Rule, Evaluation
**Key Features**:
- Policy definition
- Rule evaluation
- Compliance checking
- Policy inheritance
- Version management

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation
1. Create unified value objects
2. Implement conversion layers
3. Establish common patterns
4. Add comprehensive tests

### Phase 2: Migration
1. Gradual adoption of unified models
2. Legacy compatibility layer
3. Performance optimization
4. Monitoring and validation

### Phase 3: Enhancement
1. Advanced business logic
2. Cross-context integration
3. Performance improvements
4. Feature enhancements

## Code Structure

```rust
// Common pattern for each bounded context
mod unified {
    // Aggregate roots
    pub struct AggregateRoot { ... }
    
    // Value objects
    pub struct ValueObject { ... }
    
    // Domain events
    pub enum DomainEvent { ... }
    
    // Conversion utilities
    impl AggregateRoot {
        pub fn from_legacy(legacy: LegacyType) -> Self { ... }
        pub fn to_legacy(&self) -> LegacyType { ... }
    }
}
```

## Benefits

### 1. Consistency
- Unified patterns across all contexts
- Consistent naming conventions
- Standardized error handling

### 2. Maintainability
- Clear separation of concerns
- Reduced duplication
- Easier testing

### 3. Extensibility
- Easy to add new features
- Plugin-friendly architecture
- Future-proof design

### 4. Performance
- Optimized data structures
- Efficient queries
- Caching opportunities

## Migration Guidelines

### For Existing Code
1. **Gradual Migration**: Use conversion utilities
2. **Backward Compatibility**: Maintain legacy interfaces
3. **Testing**: Ensure comprehensive test coverage
4. **Documentation**: Update all relevant documentation

### For New Features
1. **Unified Models**: Use new unified models
2. **Domain Events**: Leverage event-driven architecture
3. **Value Objects**: Create rich value objects
4. **Aggregate Design**: Follow aggregate root patterns

## Next Steps

1. **Implementation**: Implement unified models for each context
2. **Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage
3. **Migration**: Gradual migration from legacy models
4. **Documentation**: Update all documentation
5. **Training**: Team training on new patterns
6. **Monitoring**: Performance and usage monitoring
