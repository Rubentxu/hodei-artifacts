# Scripts Directory

This directory contains utility scripts for the Hodei Artifacts API project.

## test_api.sh

A comprehensive test script for the Hodei Artifacts API that validates all endpoints, OpenAPI specification, and Swagger UI functionality.

### Features

- âœ… Automated server startup and shutdown
- âœ… Health endpoint validation
- âœ… OpenAPI specification verification
- âœ… Swagger UI accessibility check
- âœ… Schema endpoints testing
- âœ… Policy endpoints testing
- âœ… IAM endpoints testing
- âœ… Playground endpoint testing
- âœ… Colored output for easy reading
- âœ… Multiple execution modes

### Prerequisites

- `curl` - For making HTTP requests
- `cargo` - For building the project
- `jq` (optional) - For enhanced JSON validation

### Usage

```bash
# Run all tests (builds, starts server, runs tests)
./scripts/test_api.sh

# Start server only (for manual testing)
./scripts/test_api.sh -s

# Run tests against an already running server
./scripts/test_api.sh -t

# Use a custom API URL
./scripts/test_api.sh -u http://localhost:8080

# Show help
./scripts/test_api.sh -h
```

### Test Modes

#### Full Test Mode (Default)

Builds the project, starts the server, runs all tests, and provides a summary:

```bash
./scripts/test_api.sh
```

This mode:
1. Checks for required dependencies
2. Builds the release binary (if needed)
3. Starts the server in the background
4. Waits for the server to be ready (up to 60 seconds)
5. Runs all endpoint tests
6. Displays a comprehensive summary
7. Keeps the server running for manual testing
8. Press Ctrl+C to stop

#### Server Only Mode

Starts the server without running tests:

```bash
./scripts/test_api.sh -s
```

Useful when you want to:
- Manually test endpoints
- Use Swagger UI for interactive testing
- Keep the server running for development

#### Tests Only Mode

Runs tests against an already running server:

```bash
./scripts/test_api.sh -t
```

Useful when:
- The server is already running
- You want to quickly re-run tests
- Testing against a remote server

#### Custom URL Mode

Test against a different server:

```bash
./scripts/test_api.sh -u http://production.example.com
```

### Test Coverage

The script validates the following:

1. **Health Endpoint** (`/health`)
   - Returns 200 OK
   - Valid JSON response with status

2. **OpenAPI Specification** (`/api-docs/openapi.json`)
   - Valid OpenAPI 3.0 format
   - Counts endpoints and schemas
   - Validates JSON structure

3. **Swagger UI** (`/swagger-ui/`)
   - UI is accessible
   - Contains swagger-ui content

4. **Schema Endpoints** (`/api/v1/schemas/*`)
   - Build schema endpoint
   - Load schema endpoint

5. **Policy Endpoints** (`/api/v1/policies/*`)
   - Policy validation
   - Policy evaluation

6. **IAM Endpoints** (`/api/v1/iam/*`)
   - List policies
   - Create policy

7. **Playground Endpoint** (`/api/v1/playground/evaluate`)
   - Policy evaluation in playground mode

### Output

The script provides colored output:

- ðŸ”µ **[INFO]** - Informational messages
- ðŸŸ¢ **[SUCCESS]** - Successful operations
- ðŸŸ¡ **[WARNING]** - Warnings (non-critical issues)
- ðŸ”´ **[ERROR]** - Errors (critical failures)

### Exit Codes

- `0` - All tests passed successfully
- `1` - One or more tests failed or error occurred

### Configuration

The script uses the following defaults:

- **API URL**: `http://localhost:3000`
- **Startup Timeout**: 60 seconds (30 attempts Ã— 2 seconds)
- **Binary Path**: `./target/release/hodei-artifacts-api`
- **Run Mode**: `release`

These can be customized by modifying the script or using environment variables.

### Troubleshooting

#### Server fails to start

```
[ERROR] Server failed to start within timeout period
```

**Solutions:**
- Check if port 3000 is already in use: `lsof -i :3000`
- Verify RocksDB database isn't locked by another process
- Check server logs for configuration errors
- Ensure `./data` directory is writable

#### Binary not found

```
[WARNING] Release binary not found, building project...
```

This is normal on first run. The script will build the project automatically.

#### Permission errors

Ensure the script is executable:

```bash
chmod +x scripts/test_api.sh
```

#### Tests fail with 422 responses

Some endpoints return 422 (Unprocessable Entity) when test payloads are intentionally incomplete or invalid. This is expected behavior and logged as warnings, not errors.

### CI/CD Integration

This script can be integrated into CI/CD pipelines:

```yaml
# GitHub Actions example
- name: Run API tests
  run: |
    timeout 120 ./scripts/test_api.sh || exit 1
```

```yaml
# GitLab CI example
test:api:
  script:
    - chmod +x scripts/test_api.sh
    - timeout 120 ./scripts/test_api.sh
```

### Development Workflow

Recommended workflow for API development:

1. **Start server for development:**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/test_api.sh -s
   ```

2. **In another terminal, make changes to code**

3. **Rebuild and restart:**
   ```bash
   # Stop server (Ctrl+C)
   cargo build --release
   ./scripts/test_api.sh -s
   ```

4. **Run quick tests:**
   ```bash
   # In another terminal
   ./scripts/test_api.sh -t
   ```

5. **Or use Swagger UI for interactive testing:**
   Open http://localhost:3000/swagger-ui/ in your browser
