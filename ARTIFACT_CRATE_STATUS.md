# Artifact Crate - Status Update

## What was fixed

1. **Compilation errors in UploadArtifactUseCase**:
   - Fixed `RepositoryId::new()` function call to pass correct parameter types
   - Added missing `ContentTypeDetectionUseCase` parameter to constructor
   - Fixed borrow issues in unit tests

2. **Unit tests for upload_artifact feature**:
   - Fixed the test cases to properly handle borrowing
   - Added proper content type detection service initialization

## Current status

- ✅ **Library compiles successfully** - No compilation errors
- ⚠️ **Some warnings remain** - Unused imports and variables that could be cleaned up
- ⚠️ **Some test errors exist** - Related to other features in the crate, not the upload_artifact feature we focused on

## Next steps

1. Clean up remaining warnings by removing unused imports
2. Fix test errors in other features (versioning, upload_progress, etc.)
3. Run the full test suite to ensure everything works correctly
